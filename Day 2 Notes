awk / gawk :
    used for pattern matching and processing language
    useful for formatting after going through a lot of data
    awk uses variable amount of whitespace as a delimter, way more dvanced as cut
    
Example 1:

awk '{print}' 'file name' --> will print all the files in a document, same as cat
awk '/latte. {print}' 'filename' --> will print every line that has latte in it, prints anything with a line that matches the pattern

Example 2:
  file with banes store and salary
    
    mike manager store 450000

  awk '{print $1,4}' 'filename'
  will output
  
    mike 450000
